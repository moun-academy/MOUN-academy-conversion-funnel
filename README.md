# Speaker Gym Funnel Tracker

This repository now contains a fully front-end tracker for your Speaker's Gym
community. Open `index.html` in your browser to manage contacts and track how
many people:

- Were contacted
- Joined the community
- Took the 7-day challenge
- Submitted their contact information for the paid 90-day program

All data is stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`, so you can use
the app offline and without any backend.

2. Open `index.html` in your browser. No server or dependencies are required.

## Importing/exporting contacts

- **Export**: Click **Export** to download a `speaker-gym-contacts.json`
  file containing your saved contacts.

  exported from the app to restore your data.
